# gayMarriageDeathPenalty

This project is aimed to visualize and compare the countries that (1) legalize same-sex marriage, or (2) are retentionists. 

The United States is the only country that recognizes same-sex marriage and uses death penalty simultaneously. 

Apart from the US, these two features of law are mutually exclusive in the rest of the world. That is, if ignoring the US, the countries that legalizing same-sex marriage have also abolished death penalty. On the contrary, the countries using capital punishment in practice or in law deny same-sex marriage.
