# gayMarriageDeathPenalty

This project is aimed to visualize and compare the countries that (1) legalize same-sex marriage, or (2) are retentionist. 

The United States is the only country that recognizes same-sex marriage and uses death penalty simultaneously. Apart from United States, these two laws are mutually exclusive in the rest of the world.
